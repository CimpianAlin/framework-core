"""
This module intends to provide a log4j/log4cxx compatibility wrapper
for python.  The primary goal is to provide the ability to configure
the built-in python "logging" module using log4j/log4cxx configuration
file.

At this time, there is no intention to fully replicate the log4j/log4cxx
API in python nor provide a wrapper of the log4cxx libraries.

To use a log4j/log4cxx configuration file:

  >> import logging
  >> import ossie.utils.log4py.config
  >> ossie.utils.log4py.config.fileConfig("log4cxx.properties")
